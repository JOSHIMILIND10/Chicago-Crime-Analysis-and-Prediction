# Chicago-Crime-Analysis-and-Prediction

We have a dataset which contains the crime record of Chicago city from 2004 to present. The dataset is in structured format which contains attributes of criminal such as
Case number, Date of Crime, Location of Crime, Description of crime and Type of Crime etc.
From this we analyse and come out with an output which can be used by police department, intelligence bureau, road and transport highway, detective agencies etc. We also predict the crime so that crime can be stopped before it is committed or at least collateral damage can be stopped. By this we will try to predict the criminal and place the crime may be committed.
